[15:51:07](https://mifos.slack.com/archives/C028634A61L/p1770393067947409) - Adam Monsen (meonkeys) - <@U0AB1LCEGJ0> hi there! Wow, 8 PRs for <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-2171|FINERACT-2171> already? That is a LOT of code. And it looks like the PRs overlap... how are these intended to be merged? This would take me a long time to review. Do we really need so much complexity for this? Who would maintain this code, and how? I'm concerned this is just kind of spiraling out of control. Does any of it run yet? Have you run/tested it?
[16:18:41](https://mifos.slack.com/archives/C028634A61L/p1770394721479659) - Aira Jena - Hi <@U07ECHYJYD8> — quick update on FINERACT-2171: I completed the MVP and consolidated everything into a single PR for review. It fetches messages, renders daily Markdown + indexes, stores cursor state, resolves permalinks, handles user display names and thread replies, plus CI automation and rate‑limit handling. I tested in my personal Slack workspace (auth, fetch, render, cursor), screenshots attached in PR description and can help set up a bot in <#C028634A61L> or a test channel for validation.
Only 1 PR need to be reviewed and merged: <https://github.com/apache/fineract-chat-archive/pull/8>

I'd also like your personal opinion on *complexity* and *maintenance*. Really I'm trying to gauge if you're going to stick around to maintain this thing, at least until it is stable. And re: maintenance, the patch for PR #8 is 2,000 lines, so I've only skimmed it. I know Java is verbose, it just seems like a lot.

Apologies, <https://lists.apache.org/thread/b2jwr5ql47bt1t600js7t237rkc1q6w2|this is a very recently added requirement>

It just takes up space. I'll add it to the commit log message when I merge to main (and I'm going to do a traditional merge, not squash -- I like preserving these incremental commits for posterity).
I have force-pushed your branch, so you'll have to fetch and do a hard reset on your end. Sorry for not warning you first -- I don't plan on doing this often.
If you'd like to add any text to the commit log messages, go right ahead.

To answer directly: *yes, I’m committed to maintaining this beyond the MVP*. I’m happy to iterate on it, simplify where needed, and gradually add improvements and features as we learn what’s most useful for the community.
[04:59:30](https://mifos.slack.com/archives/C028634A61L/p1770440370155059?thread_ts=1770416971.542499&cid=C028634A61L) - Aira Jena - -> I agree that ~2,000 lines is non-trivial. My intent for the initial implementation was to be explicit and defensive (especially around rate limiting, allow-listing, and idempotency), but I’m very open to reducing surface area and refactoring as we stabilize the design. If there are areas you feel are over-engineered for MVP, I’m glad to revisit them.
I’ve synced to your force-push and *sign all new commits* going forward — thanks for the heads-up. Also I have addressed all your comments in the PR and added the detailed guide to create the token.
