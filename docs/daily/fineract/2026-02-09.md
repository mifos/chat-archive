I'm Devavarshita, a 3rd-year CS student preparing for GSoC 2026 with Mifos.
I'm planning to contribute to Apache Fineract (Java backend) and am currently setting up the project locally on Windows.
Are there any beginner-friendly issues or areas you’d recommend I start with while I get familiar with the codebase?
Thanks, looking forward to contributing!

Our projects are for Mifos managed open source projects such as MifosX. Where the required some changes in the backend like fineract it will be contributed to our fork in the first instance.

I’m preparing for GSoC with Mifos and would love to start contributing to the Mifos-managed repositories, Since I am beginner.
Could you please point me to beginner-friendly issues in MifosX or related projects where new contributors usually start?

Sir, also it would be helpful if could verify if this the correct repo?
