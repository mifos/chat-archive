How many will review this ?

I may, if you don't. I originally proposed it at <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-2171|FINERACT-2171> and I <https://lists.apache.org/thread/9x6rftxoc4kdwp754odqvktdq2cz106h|mentioned the idea on the dev list as well>. That didn't evolve but thanks to <@U0AB1LCEGJ0> we have something to test and we can hopefully enable archiving soon. There's a <https://github.com/apache/fineract-chat-archive/pull/8|healthy discussion on the PR> so far and please, yes, anyone who wants to chime in, the more eyes the better (especially if someone has strong experience/opinion in areas like using the Slack API from Java, generating Markdown, using GH actions).
